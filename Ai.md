##Tools used
-Copilot GPT-5 mini


##Tasks

#1. A-BetterGui
-ChatGPT was used to help style the GUI

####What worked

I needed to guide the AI by showing it the relevant files and stop it from giving too many
debugging messages in the code.

####What didn't

Simply asking it to reformat it the way I wanted it did not work out. It kept hallucinating, causing 
me to have to simply look up relevant terms to prod it along

####Time saved
Negligible

###2. A-MoreTesting

####What worked

Showing the proper files for context allowed the AI to generate useful test cases

####What didn't

Just asking the AI to generate the test cases based on one file
